class PerformanceOptimizer:
    """
    A class for learning performance optimization through TDD.
    
    This class will demonstrate:
    - Code profiling and bottleneck identification
    - Caching and memoization strategies
    - Algorithm optimization techniques
    - Parallel processing and concurrency
    - Memory usage optimization
    
    Start by running the tests to see what needs to be implemented!
