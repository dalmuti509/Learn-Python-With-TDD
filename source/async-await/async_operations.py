class AsyncOperations:
    """
    A class for learning asynchronous programming through TDD.
    
    This class will demonstrate:
    - Async/await syntax and coroutines
    - Concurrent operations with asyncio
    - Asynchronous I/O operations
    - Producer-consumer patterns
    - Error handling in async code
    
    Start by running the tests to see what needs to be implemented!
