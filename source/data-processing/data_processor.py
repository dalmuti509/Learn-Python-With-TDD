    A class for learning data processing through TDD.
    
    This class will demonstrate:
    - Loading and cleaning data from various sources
    - Data transformation and manipulation
    - Statistical analysis and aggregation
    - Data validation and quality checks
    - Export and reporting functionality
    
    Start by running the tests to see what needs to be implemented!
