class FunctionalProgramming:
    """
    A class for learning functional programming concepts through TDD.
    
    This class will demonstrate:
    - Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)
    - Function composition and currying
    - Immutable data operations
    - Pure functions and memoization
    
    Start by running the tests to see what needs to be implemented!
