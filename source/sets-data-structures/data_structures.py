class DataStructures:
    """
    A class for learning Python data structures through TDD.
    
    This class will demonstrate:
    - Sets for unique collections and mathematical operations
    - Named tuples for structured data
    - Counter for frequency analysis
    - Deque for efficient queue/stack operations
    - DefaultDict for grouped data
    
    Start by running the tests to see what needs to be implemented!
