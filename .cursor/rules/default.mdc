- Whenever I ask for something that doesn't match the existing ruleset, suggest a rule change. 
- Whenever a rule is added or changed, check that everything matches the ruleset and fix anything that doesn't match
- Whenever a request is made that makes sense as a rule or element in a rule, suggest a rule change or new project rule
